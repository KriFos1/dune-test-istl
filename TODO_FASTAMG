BUGFIXES
- make old preconditioners wrapping work
- write the pre- and postprocessor for smoothers in fastamg (not a bug with all current preconditioners)
- remove -Wreorder warnings by ordering the args in fastamg

FEATURES
- correctly give the smoother parameters to the new classes
- implement ILU(n)
- switch Jacobi implementation to new interface
- export corresponding "normal" smoother to use as coarsesmoother

DOCUMENTATION

GENERAL
- code cleanup
- measure time diff between fastamg and amg with non-specialized preconditioners.
