BUGFIXES
- make old preconditioners wrapping work (really, like tested) 
- write the pre- and postprocessor for smoothers in fastamg (not a bug with all current preconditioners)

FEATURES
- finish implementing ILU(n)
- get access to directional apply methods in old preconditioners

DOCUMENTATION
- decide on a what-doxy-policy (and apply)

GENERAL
- code cleanup
- measure time diff between fastamg and amg with non-specialized preconditioners.
- decide upon which preconditioners are suitable here
